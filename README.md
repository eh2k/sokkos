Compiled using avr-gcc 4.3.3 using the supplied Makefile on a mac pro. 

The compiled version will be 15807 bytes, there are 65 bytes left. 

The output is heavily optimized for space. Be careful when editing, some 
things will be _very_ expensive to add. Inlining is shut off so try to write 
very general functions if you need to duplicate code.
